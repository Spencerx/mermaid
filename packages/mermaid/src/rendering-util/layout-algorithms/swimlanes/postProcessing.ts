  // Stale port-offset cleanup (iter 7). The Hegemann-Wolff paper
  // (source b65b3d45, Fig. 11b discussion) explicitly flags "Z-shaped
  // edges whose middle piece is short" as a post-processing cleanup
  // target. Our specific trigger: raykov's port distribution assigns
  // ±offsets when sibling edges land on the same node side, but
  // iter-5's `simplifyDetouredEdges` can later rewrite one of those
  // siblings to a different side entirely. The surviving sibling is
  // left with a stale port offset — a short perpendicular jog at the
  // polyline end whose sibling justification no longer exists.
  //
  // The cleanup scans 4-point polylines for an H-V-H / V-H-V pattern
  // where the middle segment is short (≤ JOG_MAX, matching raykov's
  // MAX_PORT_SPACING), and shifts one endpoint to collapse the jog.
  // Neighbor-alignment is preferred over node-center when a collinear
  // incident edge exists at the shared endpoint — this matches what
  // Hegemann-Wolff's full-nudging LP would achieve globally via
  // zero-separation constraints on same-path segments. This is a
  // local Mermaid proxy; the algorithmically correct long-term fix is
  // to thread `simplifyDetouredEdges`'s rewrite back into raykov's

  // visually overlaps the penultimate segment and appears detached.
  //
  // User report (2026-04-16) on L_E_G_0 in 8-query-process-2: "the final
  // stretch … is vertical going upwards. It is so close to G that when
  // it tries to bend to the right to go into it, that actual section is
  // invisible." Concretely: penult vertical at x=G.left-5.52 followed by
  // 5.52u horizontal stub into G.left-center.
  //
  // Paper backing: Siebenhaller dissertation (NotebookLM src `21f7ca55`)
  // describes a bend-stretching post-pass that replaces tail-shape
  // patterns with straighter ones. Strictly the Kandinsky invariant
  // says first/last direction never changes; this pass *does* change
  // the last direction since it also re-targets the destination face
  // (L→N in the L_E_G_0 case). Precedent: `straightenStalePortOffsets`
  // already performs port-coordinate changes in a post-pass
  // (Hegemann-Wolff short-middle-piece cleanup, source `b65b3d45`);
  // this pass extends the same philosophy to the TERMINAL short-
  // piece case.
  //

  // shifted penultimate segment must not overlap any real-node rect,
  // sibling/foreign edge segment, label rect, or the src node.
